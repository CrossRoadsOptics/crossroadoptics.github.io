Our hardware system was designed to sit on a flat roof and record an intersection from above. It was designed to operate under battery power for 12-14 hours and be reasonably weatherproof. The components are as follows:
- 5 ft. of 1.5 inch thick PVC pipe
- Weatherproof camera
- 32GB SD card
- Fillable umbrella base
- Portable battery

The user will also need the following to assemble the setup:
- 10 inch zip ties
- Gallon sealable bags
- 1.5 inch drywall screw
