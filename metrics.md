# Metrics
Our Compute Vision software provides new insight for all customers through impactful data. Visualizations of routes sets our system apart, allowing customers to know exactly where cars, people and bikers tend to travel.

## Counts and Speeds

The bread and butter of any road data is counts. We measure and record the counts of objects through the intersection, classifying the objects on the road with Computer Vision. Our classifier is trained using Neural Networks to provide higher identification accuracy.

If the user is interested in speed data, our software delivers important information in easy-to-digest forms. In the above graph, we denote the 85th percentile speed, which is a crucial statistic used by traffic departments to determine road speed limits.

## Video Tracking

Our data goes beyond simple counts, as we track the path of cars, bikes and pedestrians. This allows customers to map the most active parts of their site, as well as look at the 'one-offs', where travelers varied from the normal route. With this new data, customers get insight as to where signage can be employed to greatest effect.

## Turning Counts

Turning counts have been proven to be crucial in understanding the importance of traffic lights at intersections. Automating them up to this point has proven difficult, but our algorithm has shown great success in determining the routing of road users. Shop owners will understand how many pedestrians are walking into their store, while advocates can determine the number of bikers making turns at a busy intersection.

## Comparisons over Time and Distance

We know that understanding the data at one point might not be enough, so we can compare data over time and distance. Data across time allows customers to understand the differences traffic between day and night, or weekday and weekend. Customers that want to see the affect of new signage can deploy our system, monitor before and after and see the difference. If understanding the differences between two sites is more in line with what a customer needs, we compare this data as well. Distance comparison can be useful if a customer wants to compare success of a sale at two stores, or advocates want to highlight the difference in danger between two intersections.


## Identifying Near Miss Incidents

Crash statistics are currently available on most roadways but this statistic alone does not tell the whole story. Near-collision events are more frequent and their analysis is as valuable as actual crash statistics in detecting systemic safety problems. By looking at near misses, our software evaluates the safety of an intersection. With this data advocates can enact changes before injuries occur.
