# Metrics
Santos Traffic Platform produces metrics for anyone to run their own traffic study.

## Video Tracking

Our visualization of traffic footage with tracking goes beyond simple counts, as we mark the path of cars, bikes and pedestrians. This allows users to potentially map the most active parts of intersections, as well as look at the 'one-offs', where road users varied from the normal pathing. 


## Counts and Speeds

We measure and record the counts and speeds of road users through the intersection, as well as track the 85 percentile speed of vehicles. This 85 percentile is a crucial statistic used by traffic departments to determine road speed limits. 


## Turning Counts

Turning counts have been proven to be crucial is understanding the importance of traffic lights at intersections. Automating them up to this point has proven difficult, but our algorithm has shown great success in determining the pathing of vehicles in an intersection.


## Comparisons over Time and Distance

We know that understanding the data at one point might not enough, so we can compare data at an intersection over time, allowing a software user to understand the differences in day and night, or weekday and weekend traffic. If understanding the differences between two  intersections is more in line with what you want, we can compare the data between them to better highlight problematic roadways. 


## Identifying Near Miss Incidents

Crash statistics are currently available on most roadways but this statistic alone does not tell the whole story. Near-collision events are more frequent and their analysis is as valuable as actual crash statistics in detecting systemic safety problems. By looking at near misses, we can better understand the safety of an intersection **before** someone is injured.
