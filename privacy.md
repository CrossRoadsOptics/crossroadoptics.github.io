# Privacy Policy

## Project Background

We are working to reduce traffic accidents by providing a comprehensive understanding of traffic infrastructure. Due to the high cost and reliability of collected data, the current approach to intersection safety is reactive. Metrics on intersection safety are generally collected after citizens complain or when there is a history of a significant number of accidents. Our traffic camera system, is easy to install and maintain, combined with computer vision software, can deliver more reliable metrics assessing the safety aspects of a street or intersection. This tool enables a low cost proactive solution to evaluating traffic safety, preventing accidents and saving lives.

## Protocol Rationale

This policy outlines our common practices to dispel concerns regarding the recording and analysis of video collected in public areas.

## Data Collection

The video will be recorded of public areas. Therefore there is no expectation of privacy. Per the Massachusetts Phone Tap laws, no audio will be recorded. A maximum of 48 hours is recorded locally on the camera, and after that time, the video is overwritten.

## Data Management

Data will be collected from our camera(s) and transferred to a private server. The videos are low-resolution to prevent any distinguishing features from being recorded. Videos may be used in public presentations of our work on the TrafficGUI software.  In any such cases, any remaining identifying details will be obfuscated. Data will not be stored long term.
## Data Processing

The software will track and store the trajectories of moving objects but the software will not store any information about the moving object, other than its classification as a pedestrian, vehicle, or bicycle.

## Data Release

Data will not be released except under the following situations:

- As required by law to cooperate with law enforcement.
- Any other unforeseen circumstance in which the public benefit outweighs any other concerns.
