# Quantifying Roads through Computer Vision

CrossRoad Optics is a simple solution that provides much needed data for understanding roadways. 

### Why do we need new data?

The current system for collecting traffic data centers around manually counting over several hours. This means that every time someone wants to know how many pedestrians cross the street, or how many bikes are using a path, someone has to go out and count. Why, in a digital world, do we rely on people to count cars on a road? 

CrossRoad Optics employs a powerful arsenal of advanced computing to monitor, count, and track how people use our roads today. Using a small sensor, we collect continual data on sight, and produce a wide variety of [metrics](/metrics/). Customers, empowered by this new layer of data, can act with confidence in an increasingly uncertain world.

#### Solutions for Enterprise

Using CrossRoad Optics, businesses can better understand the flow of the world around them. Using our sensor, a shop owner can compare the effects of a sale on the number of customers coming in and a developer can track the changes in traffic over weeks and months, providing a better estimate on the number of daily visitors.
