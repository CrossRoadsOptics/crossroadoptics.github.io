# Improving Transportation Safety through Data-Driven Technologies

Many of us can think of an intersection in our town or city where traffic feels unsafe. The impact of an unsafe road is felt by every user, from drivers, to bikers and pedestrians. In 2016 alone, there were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States. Any one of those fatalities could happen at an intersection close to your home; areas we typically assume to be safe.

Many people are engaged in improving road infrastructure to create safer intersections. Quicker and more complete traffic studies can greatly expedite these changes, and increase road safety for everyone.

The CrossRoad Platform will make change possible. Our cloud-based analysis tool provides actionable safety metrics from collected video data to those who are working to improve traffic safety.
