# Creating CrossRoad Optics
## A Journey from Idea to Action

In 2017, two classmates from the [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/) ventured forward with a project born from the school's [Senior Capstone program](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope). The project, brought to the school by the [Santos Family Foundation](http://fdnweb.org/santos/), originated back in 2014, when the first of three teams began to tackle the foundation's proposed problem: Road Safety. After 3 years of ideation and development, the project's final team developed a software solution to monitor roads and measure safety at intersections. The Santos Foundation was pleased with the results, but lacked the necessary tools to distribute the software and develop it further. They sponsored two members of the final team to take the software, and create a thriving business. 


The two members, Jacob Riedel and Ryan Louie, created CrossRoad Optics and have been working through the 2017 Babson Summer Venture program, an accelerator designed for Babson, Olin, and Wellesley College students and graduates..
