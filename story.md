# Creating CrossRoad Optics
## A Journey from Idea to Action

In 2017, two classmates from [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/) ventured forward with a project born form the school's [Senior Capstone program](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope). The project, brought to the school by the [Santos Family Foundation](http://fdnweb.org/santos/), originated back in 2014, when the first of three teams began to tackle the foundations proposed issue: Road Safety. After 3 years of ideation and development, the project's final team developed a software solution to monitor roads and measure safety at intersections. The Santos Foundation was pleased with the results, but laced the necessary tools to distribute and further develop the software. They sponsored two members of the final team to take the software, and create a thriving business. 

Now, these members, Jacob Riedel and Ryan Louie, created CrossRoad Optics and have been working through the 2017 Babson Summer Venture program.
