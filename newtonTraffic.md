# Featured User: Newton Traffic Department

Traffic Engineers are prevented from proactively justifying effective traffic safety decisions without access to quantitative data.

We met with engineers and planners from Newton, MA to discuss our system and the way in which it could help them make intersections
safer.

## Looking at the whole picture

According to one of Newton's engineers, there is not an automated system that tracks bikes and pedestrians in addition to cars.
Seperate systems exist but no system can unify all three. Bikes and pedestrians are the most vulnerable users of intersections.
It is crucial to have a system that can generate a comprehensive analysis to evaulate the safety of an intersection.

## Finding Effective Traffic Interventions

Newton's traffic department often conducts traffic intervention pilot studies. Various changes at intersections are created to 
alter the behavior of road users including a temporary bump out around a curb or painting a suggested turning lane for cars.
However, they do not have quantifible data that shows the effects of these intervention; they rely on their own subjective data
based on observations to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

What is needed is a system that will give them powerful, quantitative metrics in order for them to make smart decisions about interventions
that should become permanent. Our system provided these metrics. When they pilot a temporary turning lane our software can produce before 
and after images detailing the trajectories of cars turning in the intersection. When they test a bump-out, we can produce graphs 
illustrating altered trajectories changes in speeds, and closeness of interactions between road users.
