# About

The Santos Platform project was created by teams of engineering students at Olin College of Engineering. The [Santos Family Foundation](http://fdnweb.org/santos/) sponsored a three-year long senior capstone project. These three teams of seniors worked together with the Foundation with the goal of creating a technology to reduce traffic deaths.

These are the current seniors working on the project:

- Deniz Celik
- Ryan Louie
- Jacob Riedel
- Philip Seger
- Sawyer Vaughan
