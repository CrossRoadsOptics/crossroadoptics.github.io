# About

We at CrossRoad Optics are dedicated to creating a comprehensive automated traffic study in the hopes of providing a holistic understanding of intersections and an increased focus on traffic safety.

CrossRoad Optics was created by former members of the Santos senior capstone project at Olin College of Engineering. The [Santos Family Foundation](http://fdnweb.org/santos/) sponsored the origin of this three-year long project and have continued to show support for the growing business.to reduce traffic deaths.
