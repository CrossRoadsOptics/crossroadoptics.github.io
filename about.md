# About

CrossRoad Optics is dedicated to creating automated traffic studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of intersections with an increased focus on quantifiable traffic safety parameters.

CrossRoad Optics was created by former members of the Santos senior capstone project at Olin College of Engineering. The [Santos Family Foundation](http://fdnweb.org/santos/) sponsored the origin of this multi-year project and continues to show support for the growing business and its goal to reduce traffic deaths.
