## How Neighborways create safer roads in communities
Neighborways are created by painting streets and implementing other interventions with the hope of calming traffic and engaging people to actively use the street for walking, playing, and biking.

Side-streets that run parallel to major thoroughfares are good candidates for becoming a neighborway. In Somerville, the hope is to turn a series of side-streets into neighborways, creating a network of safe streets for non-vehicular traffic.

We met with Mark Chase, one of the leaders of the Somerville Neighborway Streets project, to discuss how our system could help measure the change in community transportation patterns resulting from these planned interventions.

## Tracking changes in the transportation patterns of walkers and bikers

According to Mark Chase, there is not a reliable sensor that can track pedestrians and bicyclists. Almost every municipality has the ability to count cars by placing down pneumatic tubes. However, more complex data such as, turning and non-vehicle counts must be collected by individuals stationed with a clipboard at the corner of an intersection.

The effect of bicycle and pediatrician traffic can be measured after transforming streets into neighborways. Neighborways can benefit from the metrics generated by our system. Data can be collected over a longer period of time and over multiple days without the additional increase in staffing cost.

## Motivating towards positive city action in Somerville, MA  

We are piloting video collection at the intersection of Elm Street and Hancock Street in the Porter Square Station / Somerville area.  A volunteer from the Somerville Streets organization will be collecting hours of video from their second-story porch overlooking the intersection.

This pilot is in progress. Updates will be posted here.
