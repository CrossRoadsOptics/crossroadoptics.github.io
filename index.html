	<h2>Santos Family Foundation SCOPE Project</h2>
	<p>We are a team of five students who are currently attending Olin College of Engineering. For our year-long senior capstone project (SCOPE), we are working with the Santos Family Foundation to improve traffic safety through by enabling infrastructure change. We are building a system to collect and analyze intersection video data in order to allow traffic engineers and advocacy groups to have access to quantitative data that would allow them to make informed and accurate decisions about infrastructure change.</p>
	<p>We have already created software that analyzes video of an intersection for important data, such as vehicle counts, vehicle classification, vehicle speeds, and many other important safety metrics. Our hope is that we will be able to distribute this software to allow advocacy groups, traffic engineers, or concerned citizens to gather data that makes a convincing case for infrastructure change at an intersection.</p>
