# Smarter Business uses Data to Drive Development

## Retailers and Realtors

Growing retail companies are constantly looking to set up new stores. In order for these stores to add to the business growth, retailers look for the site optimized for their business. When considering where to build, these companies rely on realtors, either internal or external, to provide all the available information, from local demographics, to daily foot traffic, and choose where to develop based on this data. 

Traditionally, realtors who collect foot-count data hire a contractor to manually collect these counts. Manual collection is costly, both in time and money, and often misses potentially crucial data. What is the site like at dinner time? How many people come by on a rainy day? What about the difference in Summer vs Winter traffic? Most likely, people hired to count won't be willing to stand outside for hours on end, missing dinner, getting drenched in rain, or freezing in the winter. As a result, realtors are limited in the data they can provide, and retail businesses may choose the wrong site to build, a mistake that can cost millions. 

CrossRoad Optics collects in rain or shine and our continuous data provides a better understanding of traffic over longer periods of time. Realtors with this level of data can show the long-term value of their site and retail companies can make more informed decisions on where to build.

For many companies, choosing the right place can make or break the business. Make the right call with CrossRoad Optics
